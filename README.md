# Audioclassifier
Audio Classification with UrbanSound8K (PyTorch + Kaggle GPU) This project builds an end‑to‑end audio classification model using the UrbanSound8K dataset and trains it on free Kaggle GPUs. The goal is to identify urban sounds such as dog barks, car horns, drilling, sirens, and more from short audio clips.
